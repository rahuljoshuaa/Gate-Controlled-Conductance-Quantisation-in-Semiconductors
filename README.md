# Gate-Controlled Conductance Quantisation in Semiconductors

## Overview
This repository contains my final year project, which investigates gate-controlled conductance quantisation in quantum point contacts (QPCs) using a MATLAB-based simulation framework. By modelling a smooth saddle-point potential, the project explores how discrete conductance steps emerge from quantum confinement in one-dimensional channels.

Key goals achieved include:
- Modelling electron transport in a saddle-point potential using MATLAB  
- Exploring the impact of confinement strength (ωy/ωx) on quantised conductance  
- Studying the effects of in-plane and perpendicular magnetic fields (Zeeman splitting and Landau quantisation)  
- Analysing material-specific properties (effective mass, Landé g-factor)  
- Quantifying thermal broadening effects using differential conductance and FWHM metrics  

These results align with theoretical predictions and provide insight into spin-resolved transport, guiding the design of future experimental and simulation-based quantum devices.
