This repository contains my final year project, which investigates gate-controlled conductance quantisation in quantum point contacts (QPCs) using a MATLAB-based simulation framework. The work models electron transport through a smooth saddle-point potential to study how discrete conductance steps emerge from quantum confinement in one-dimensional channels. The simulation explores the influence of confinement ratio (ωy/ωx), in-plane and perpendicular magnetic fields, semiconductor material properties (effective mass and Landé g-factor), and temperature. Results highlight several key phenomena: sharper mode separation under stronger transverse confinement, spin-resolved subbands via Zeeman splitting, Landau quantisation stabilising conductance plateaus, and thermal broadening of conductance steps analysed with differential methods and FWHM metrics. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions and provide valuable insight into spin-resolved transport in nanoscale systems, helping guide the design of future experimental and simulation-based quantum devices.
